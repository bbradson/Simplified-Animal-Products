# Bradsons-Simplified-Animal-Products

Original mod made by trublucaribou. This is a rewrite for better compatibility and slightly shorter load times, but otherwise the same features.
Extending this mod to wool, eggs and milk is planned, but I haven't started work on that yet.

From trublucaribou's description:
This mod completely overhauls the current leather system in the game, along with patching a dozen plus other animal mods. It introduces the following "new" leather types: sturdy leather (from animals like elephants and rhinos), thick pelt (from animals like bears and alphabeavers), longfur pelt (from cold weather animals like wolves and foxes), shorthair pelt (from warm weather animals like lions and camels), coarse fur (from small animals like rats and raccoons), soft fur (from most pets and wild animals like rabbits), and luxe fur (from rare small critters with valuable pelts).

		The final list of leathers includes: Coarse fur, soft fur, luxe fur, heavy fur, light leather, plain leather, sturdy leather, shorthair pelt, longfur pelt, thick pelt, bird skin, lizard skin, human leather, and thrumbofur.
